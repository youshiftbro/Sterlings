## Corporation Tax

### Rates (2025/26)

| Profit Level | Rate | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| £0 - £50,000 | 19% | Small profits rate |
| £50,001 - £250,000 | 19-25% | Marginal Relief applies |
| Over £250,000 | 25% | Main rate |

**Marginal Relief Formula:**
```
Tax = Profits × 25% - (£250,000 - Profits) × 3/200
```

**Thresholds reduced by:**
- Short accounting periods (pro-rata)
- Number of associated companies

### Payment Deadlines
- **Small companies:** 9 months + 1 day after accounting period end
- **Large companies:** Quarterly instalments
- **CT600 filing:** 12 months after accounting period end

---

## Director's Loan Account (DLA)

### What is a Director's Loan?
Money taken from company that is NOT:
- Salary or dividend
- Expense repayment
- Repayment of money you previously loaned to company

### Section 455 Tax

If director owes company money at year-end and doesn't repay within **9 months + 1 day**:

| Loan Date | Tax Rate |
|-----------|----------|
| Before 6 April 2022 | 32.5% |
| On or after 6 April 2022 | **33.75%** |

**Reclaiming S455:**
- Can reclaim after loan repaid (9 months + 1 day after repayment period ends)
- Cannot reclaim interest paid on the tax
- Claim within 4 years

### Benefit in Kind Threshold

If DLA > **£10,000** at any point in tax year:
- Treat as benefit in kind
- Report on P11D
- Deduct Class 1 NI
- Director pays tax on official interest rate (check [current HMRC rate](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-beneficial-loan-arrangements-hmrc-official-rates))

### Bed & Breakfasting Rules (Anti-Avoidance)

If loan > £15,000 and you repay then borrow again within 30 days:
- S455 tax still applies on original loan
- Cannot avoid by quick repay/re-borrow

### DLA Management Best Practices

**Monthly:**
- Reconcile all personal expenses paid by company
- Update DLA balance in accounting software
- Flag if approaching £10,000 (BIK threshold)

**Before Year-End:**
- Review total DLA position
- Plan repayment strategy:
  - Vote dividend to offset (if reserves available)
  - Actual cash repayment
  - Include in salary (creates tax/NI but clears DLA)
- If can't clear: budget for S455 tax

**Documentation:**
- Board minutes for any loans formally approved
- Clear categorization in accounts (drawings vs loans vs expenses)
- Dividend vouchers if using dividends to offset

**Warning Signs:**
- DLA growing faster than dividends can cover
- Using company as "personal piggy bank"
- Mixing business/personal cards regularly
- No monthly reconciliation

**The £10,000 Threshold:**
Once DLA exceeds £10,000 at ANY point in tax year:
- Entire beneficial loan becomes BIK
- Report on P11D
- Pay Class 1A NI (15%)
- Director pays income tax on official interest rate benefit
- This applies even if you repay before year-end

---

- × Time spent working from home

**Claimable costs (apportioned):**
- Heating
- Electricity
- Council Tax (proportion)

- Internet and phone (proportion)

**Method:** Company pays director a rent for use of home office. Must be:

*Employer threshold dropped from £9,100 to £5,004, rate increased from 13.8% to 15%*

### Optimal Director Salary Strategy (2025/26)
The employer NI changes affect optimal salary calculations. Common approaches:

**Option 1:** Salary at **Lower Earnings Limit** (~£6,500)
- Preserves state pension credits
- Minimal employer NI exposure

**Option 2:** Salary at **employee threshold** (~£12,584)
- No employee NI
- Some employer NI (on ~£7,580 above employer threshold)

**Option 3:** Salary at **personal allowance** (£12,570)
- Uses full tax-free allowance
- Employer pays 15% NI on excess over £5,004

*Higher employer NI makes dividends relatively more attractive. Consult accountant for optimal split.*

## R&D Tax Credits

### What Qualifies
Projects seeking advance in **science or technology** by resolving **technological uncertainty**.

**Must demonstrate:**
- Competent professional couldn't solve it easily
- Advance benefits the field, not just your company
- Uncertainty about if/how it could be done

**Qualifies:**
- Creating new processes, materials, devices, products, services
- Appreciably improving existing ones
- Using science/tech to replicate something in a new way

**Does NOT qualify:**
- Arts, humanities, social sciences
- Routine improvements
- Cosmetic/style changes

### Qualifying Costs

| Cost Type | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Staff costs | Salaries, NI, pension for R&D staff |
| Consumables | Materials used up in R&D |
| Software | Licence fees for R&D software |
| Subcontractors | 65% of unconnected contractor costs |
| Data/Cloud | From April 2023 |
| EPWs | Externally provided workers (65%) |

**Cannot claim:**

- Rent, rates, leasing

### Rates (Accounting periods from 1 April 2024)

**Merged Scheme (replaced SME/RDEC):**
- **Above the line credit:** 20% of qualifying R&D spend
- Creates a taxable credit

**Enhanced R&D Intensive Support:**
- For R&D intensive SMEs (R&D spend > 30% of total spend)
- Additional relief available

### Speed Capital R&D Potential

**Strong Candidates:**

| Project | Why It May Qualify | Evidence Needed |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| AI coaching algorithms | Technological uncertainty in replicating human coaching judgment | Technical specs, failed approaches, competent professional statement |
| Novel telemetry analysis | If creating new methods beyond standard data viz | Documentation of what's "new to the field" |
| Simulation physics improvements | If contributing to engine development, not just using it | Collaboration docs with sim platform |
| Adaptive difficulty/training systems | ML approaches with genuine uncertainty | Training data experiments, iteration logs |

**Weak/Unlikely Candidates:**
- Using existing tools in standard ways
- UI/UX improvements (unless technically novel)
- Content creation (tracks, cars) — usually not "technological"
- Routine software development with known solutions

**Documentation Requirements:**
1. **Contemporaneous records** — timesheets showing R&D hours vs BAU
2. **Technical narrative** — what uncertainty existed, how you tried to resolve it
3. **Competent professional** — someone who can explain why this wasn't obvious
4. **Cost allocation** — which staff, what % of their time, consumables used

**Claim Process (from April 2024):**
1. Submit **Additional Information Form** before or with CT600
2. Describe projects in technical terms
3. HMRC may enquire — be ready to defend
4. Use specialist R&D advisor for first claim (they take ~15-25% of benefit but handle compliance)

**Rates (Merged Scheme 2024+):**
- 20% above-the-line credit on qualifying spend
- If R&D intensive (>30% of costs), enhanced support available
- Credit is taxable but can offset CT liability

## Racing-Specific Tax Guidance (Super Veloce Ltd)

### Clearly Deductible for Racing Driver
- **Race entry fees** — direct business cost
- **Travel to races** — flights, hotels, transfers (wholly business)
- **Race suit, helmet, HANS device** — required safety equipment
- **Team branded clothing** — promotional/uniform
- **Simulator time** — training directly related to racing
- **Coaching fees** — driver coaching, data engineering
- **Race car parts/consumables** — if company owns/operates car
- **Medical certificates** — required for race licence
- **Race licence fees** — mandatory for business
- **Data subscriptions** — timing, telemetry services

### Gray Areas — Document Carefully
- **Gym membership** — deductible IF contractually required by team OR demonstrably necessary for role (document this)
- **Nutrition/supplements** — likely personal unless team contract requires specific regime
- **Physio/sports massage** — deductible if injury is work-related or preventative for racing specifically
- **Flights for "testing"** — ensure documented as business, not leisure + driving

### Likely Personal (Drawings)
- **Everyday clothing** — even if worn to paddock
- **Personal meals** — unless genuinely entertaining clients/sponsors
- **Family travel to races** — personal
- **Non-racing holidays** — even if combined with a track day

### Asset vs Expense
- **Sim rig at home** — capital allowance (100% AIA), not expense
- **Helmet** — could be either (if < £1k, pragmatically expense it)
- **Race car** — definitely capital, complex treatment if company-owned

---

## Sim Racing Business (Speed Capital Ltd)

### Clearly Deductible
- **SimGrid infrastructure** — servers, software, subscriptions
- **Coach Dave Delta development** — staff, contractors, software
- **Sim hardware for testing** — business asset
- **Content creator payments** — if contracted
- **Tournament prize pools** — if SimGrid operates tournaments

### R&D Candidates (Document Carefully)
- **Novel simulation algorithms** — if technologically uncertain
- **New training methodologies** — if measurably advancing the field
- **AI/ML coaching tools** — strong candidate if genuine uncertainty
- **Telemetry analysis innovation** — possible if creating new methods

Keep timesheets. Separate R&D staff time from BAU operations.

## Common Director Pitfalls

### 1. Mixing Personal and Business
❌ Using business card for personal shopping, then "forgetting" to log it
✅ Separate cards, immediate logging, clear DLA tracking

### 2. Entertainment Confusion
❌ "I discussed business at dinner" — still disallowable
✅ Staff entertainment (Christmas party etc) IS allowable (within limits)
Note: Client entertaining is NEVER deductible, even if genuine business purpose

### 3. Overdrawn DLA Ignored
❌ Building up drawings without tracking
✅ Monthly DLA reconciliation, plan repayment before year-end

### 4. Mileage vs Actual Costs
❌ Claiming both mileage AND fuel
✅ Choose one method per vehicle, stick to it

### 5. Home Office Double-Dip
❌ Claiming simplified expenses (self-employed method) through Ltd
✅ Company pays director rent, director declares income, offsets actual costs

### 6. "It's for Work" Justification
❌ "I need nice clothes for meetings" — still personal
✅ Branded uniform with company logo — deductible
The test: Would you wear it outside work? If yes, it's personal.
