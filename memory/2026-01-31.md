# 2026-01-31 - Mission Control Built, CFO Mindset Shift

## 🔧 Code Quality Initiative (Late Night)
David called out gross inline CSS in Mission Control. Created `CODING-STANDARDS.md` with strict rules:
- No inline CSS ever - use separate .css files
- No inline JS - use separate .js files  
- CSS variables for design tokens
- Semantic HTML structure
- QA rejects code that violates standards

**DONE:** Refactored Mission Control - CSS/JS in separate files

## 🎯 Mission Control Now LIVE as Real Work Tracker
- Added real tasks via API as work happens
- Currently tracking: 6 tasks (2 complete, 1 running, 3 pending)
- 2 flags open (Xero OAuth blocker, 8 missing invoices)
- Activity log capturing all changes
- 7am reminder set to message David with update

## Major Accomplishments

### 🎯 Mission Control App - LIVE
- Built central task/status dashboard at `http://localhost:3001`
- Node.js/Express, Bootstrap 5, Stripe-inspired design
- Features: task management, flags system, activity log, SSE real-time updates
- JSON file storage in `data/` (tasks.json, flags.json, activity.json)
- Server running: session `warm-sable`, pid 23606
- Git initialized and committed

### 📊 Xero Validation Page - WORKING
- Fixed accuracy bar visual bug (was 0% width, now shows 90% animated)
- Fixed error banner persistence (SSE was overwriting loaded results)
- Current accuracy: 89.9% (71/79 invoices matched)
- 8 unmatched: 5 from July-Aug 2025 (newer than export), 3 with amount differences
- Screenshot taken as proof at 22:38 GMT

### 🧠 Role Evolution
- Promoted to CTO / Technical Director / CFO
- **Key shift**: I think and spec, I don't code
- Team structure defined:
  - Clark (Opus) → Sarah (PM, Sonnet) → Devs (Morgan/Tracy/Simon on Codex) → QA (Sonnet)
- Delegation rules written to MEMORY.md

## David's Challenge
> "A proactive, over-qualified UK Accountant would come to me with solutions on how to prove they can do my accounting while I am on the road racing."

**My response**: Build systems that make accounting invisible. Don't wait for commands - anticipate needs, solve problems, report progress.

## Blockers
- Xero OAuth tokens expired (30 min lifespan, no refresh saved)
- Need to re-auth before live validation runs

## Files Created/Modified
- `mission-control/` - entire new app
- `mission-control/SPEC.md` - full specification
- `mission-control/server.js` - Express server with full API
- `mission-control/public/index.html` - Dashboard UI
- `clarks-proving-ground/public/xero-validation.html` - fixed accuracy bar + error banner

## Task Queue for Tomorrow
1. Research UK accountant requirements (FRS 102, MTD, Companies House)
2. Re-auth Xero for live validation
3. Build expense tracking module
4. Come back to David with PROPOSAL, not questions

## Learnings
- Be proactive, not reactive
- Token economy matters - don't read memory on every message
- Spec first, delegate second, review third
- I'm responsible for impressing David - sub-agents report to me, I report to him
